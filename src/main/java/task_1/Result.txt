Constructor worked
Bean F was initialized
A{name='class A named with properties', number=1}
B{field_A=A{name='class A named with properties', number=1}, number=2}
C{number=3}
d = D{number=4}
dd = D{number=4}
d == dd is false, because scope - prototype
E{number=5}
Replace method doingSomething in class E!
F{number=6}
Bean F will be deleted now!
